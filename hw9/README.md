# Homweork 9: USB Communication
This project uses MPLab's Harmony Wizard to configure the PIC32 for USB CDC. The code reads data from an IMU at 5Hz, publishing that data to an LCD screen. If the user presses 'r' 100 IMU values will be printed to the computer terminal screen at 100Hz (with the 5Hz LCD printing happening in the background).
