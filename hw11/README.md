# Homework 11: Tilt-Sensitive Computer Mouse

This project uses the IMU from [homework 7](../hw7) to serve as a computer mouse. It moves in the direction the accelerometer is tilted in and the speed of movement is proportional to the angle of tilt. MPLAB's USB HID configuration wizard was used to construct the code framework. The USER button connected to pin RB4 on the PIC32 serves as a left click button.
